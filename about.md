### Bio

Hi, I'm Marc, an Electrical Engineer and 3rd year PhD Student with Jürgen Becker at KIT in Karlsruhe, Germany. Based just at the foothills of the Black Forest, I enjoy mountaineering, mushroom hunting, or skiing (when the weather is right). 
Occasionally, I also enjoy optimizing deployment techniques for embedded systems based on FPGAs, CGRAs, and SoCs. I am fortunate, that some of my work has been used for the Belle II Detector in Tsukuba, Japan. On my journey, I have learned one thing or another which I will be sharing on here for y'all.
